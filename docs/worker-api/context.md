# CONTEXT Worker API

**English** · [简体中文](context.zh-CN.md) · [Worker API](README.md)

CONTEXT manages working context through LOAD, SELECT, UPDATE, and COMPRESS. Calls either transform an explicit Context or address temporary cached state by scope. Redis is the default cache adapter when an application-owned client is injected; ContextStateStore supports replaceable backends. `createContext()` opens no connections. Only scoped calls access the configured cache. MEMORY owns durable database records.

## Functional selection and parameter effects

| Node | Suitable tasks | Controls and state effects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CONTEXT.LOAD` | Initialize messages, Skills, evidence and references; restore a working set | `sources` supplies content; `resolveReferences` controls resolution. Scope plus sources initializes/replaces cache; scope alone reads existing state |
| `CONTEXT.SELECT` | Choose evidence for reasoning or reusable information for durable memory | `purpose`, `query`, `strategy`, `limit`, `maxTokens` control a projection without changing the original working set or scoped cache |
| `CONTEXT.UPDATE` | Add results, replace by ID, remove stale evidence | Removes, adds, then merges ingress; scoped mode saves with CAS |
| `CONTEXT.COMPRESS` | Fit history into budgets | `maxItems`, `maxTokens` and metadata control trimming; defaults to removing item groups, saving the result in scoped mode |

### Parameters change evidence coverage

| Parameter / design | Behavioral effect | Tradeoff and boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SELECT `limit` / COMPRESS `maxItems` | Larger values admit more items | Increase downstream input; item count is not token count, and one long document may fill the budget |
| SELECT / COMPRESS `maxTokens` | Larger values admit more estimated tokens; smaller values discard evidence more readily | A content budget excluding complete model protocols, extra prompts and output. Reserve room for them. SELECT skips optional groups that do not fit; required groups must fit |
| SELECT `purpose:"infer"` | Retains protected/safety/currentGoal/pending and system groups unchanged | Impossible budgets throw BUDGET_UNSATISFIABLE; injected strategies rank optional evidence |
| SELECT `purpose:"memory"` | Prioritizes memoryCandidate, reusable and stable; excludes private=true / memoryEligible=false | Selects without writing MEMORY; these rules are not universal permission filters |
| SELECT `query` / `strategy` | default scores current items using term overlap and other signals; rag/provider invokes injected services | Term overlap is not semantic similarity. Chinese segmentation, vector search or external knowledge needs an adapter and may add network/embedding calls |
| metadata `priority` / `relevance` | Adjusts default selection and compression retention | Application values, not calibrated confidence. Large priority values can overpower relevance |
| metadata `protected` / `safety` / `currentGoal` / `pending` / role=system | Infer SELECT and COMPRESS retain these groups unchanged | Fails if required content exceeds budget; content, source and metadata cannot be rewritten |
| metadata `callId` | Groups correlated tool entries during SELECT and COMPRESS | Keeps/removes the whole group to preserve request/result pairing; a large protected group may yield BUDGET_UNSATISFIABLE |
| LOAD `resolveReferences:true` | Resolves bare References through the resolver, retaining source identity | Defaults to false. Adds I/O, content and latency; bound access, size and permissions in the resolver |
| UPDATE IDs / policy.duplicate | replace, keep-first or reject same-ID items; new IDs add entries | replace preserves insertion position. Stable IDs avoid accumulating duplicate evidence each round |

Request limit/maxItems/maxTokens allow 0–1000000; zero is a zero budget. Policy values are positive ceilings. Defaults: maxItems=256, maxInlineBytes=65536, maxTokens unset. Higher policy does not enlarge model windows or Redis capacity; LOAD/UPDATE exceeding item capacity fail without automatic COMPRESS.

The default estimator rounds JSON UTF-8 bytes / 4 upward rather than using a model tokenizer. Actual counts vary by language, images and protocol. Inject an appropriate estimator and record actual usage for precise budgets. Default compression removes groups; semantic summaries require explicit INFER → validation → UPDATE → COMPRESS, with separate cost and information-loss evaluation.

### Scopes and Worker resources

Explicit context computes over a snapshot; scope accesses injected Redis/stateStore. They are mutually exclusive. sessionId, turnId and invocationId together identify cached state; changing turnId every turn creates a different working set. Use a consistent controlled scope for shared conversations. Multi-Agent applications may put roles in sessionId, but scopes are not authentication credentials.

expectedVersion fails on version changes or expiry instead of overwriting newer state. Longer Redis TTL improves cache availability while retaining data longer; durable tasks still need Memory. Wire Context policy/services at construction, explicitly passing loaded YAML. Request budgets can only tighten policy ceilings.

Worker concurrency limits entry calls; same-scope writes also depend on CAS and operationQueue. A configured local queue serializes by scope with default maxPending=1024. More capacity admits more waiting work and increases memory/waiting time without accelerating one scope. Local replicas sharing state need appropriate shared store/queue instances; a local queue is not cross-process concurrency control.

### A tradeoff example

If RAG retrieves 20 items, SELECT `limit:8,maxTokens:3000` keeps at most eight within the estimated budget. Raising limit to 20 may still fit only a few long items. Check selectedItemIds, required evidence and actual input usage before enlarging budgets, splitting documents or changing ranking. Shorter input can reduce cost while discarding the only critical evidence.

## Construction and configuration

Import factories from `@codesoul-co/ditto/worker/context` or the root package; import Context, ContextItem, Message and Reference from `@codesoul-co/ditto/contracts`. `createContext(options?)` and `createContextWorker(options?)` share handlers. Results are Context or ContextSelection, without a NodeResult envelope. Failures reject with ContextError or infrastructure/provider errors.

| Option | Default / behavior |
| --- | --- |
| policy.maxInlineBytes | 65536 JSON UTF-8 bytes per content; referenced items may exceed it |
| policy.maxItems | 256; final LOAD/UPDATE size and SELECT/COMPRESS ceiling |
| policy.maxTokens | Unset; SELECT/COMPRESS only, no automatic LOAD/UPDATE compression |
| policy.duplicate | replace / keep-first / reject; replacement preserves insertion position |
| policy.missingRemoval | ignore / reject |
| services | Token estimator, selector, compressor, RAG, stateStore and operationQueue |
| redis | `{ client, ttlMs?, keyPrefix? }`; mutually exclusive with services.stateStore |
| servicesFactory | Worker only; invoked once per local replica, takes precedence over services |
| concurrency | Worker only; positive integer, unlimited by default |

Use root YAML `workers.context.policy` for policy and `workers.context.cache` for ttlMs/keyPrefix. The loader exposes `config.context`; pass it explicitly when constructing clients and Workers. The application reads `.env`'s `DITTO_WORKER_CONTEXT_REDIS_URL` to construct its Redis SDK client. Config loading neither opens Redis nor implicitly loads `.env`. The application owns connect/close; Runtime.close() does not close injected Redis clients.

## Data and operations

```ts
interface ContextItem {
  id: string;
  content: MessageContent;
  source?: Reference;
  metadata?: JsonObject;
}
interface Context { items: readonly ContextItem[] }
interface ContextSelection {
  purpose: "infer" | "memory";
  context: Context;
  selectedItemIds: readonly string[];
}
```

| SDK / Node | Input | Result and semantics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| load / CONTEXT.LOAD | `{ sources: (Message \| Reference \| ContextItem)[], resolveReferences?: boolean }` | Context; canonical hashes supply stable Message/Reference IDs; Message role/name become metadata; references are only fetched when resolveReferences=true |
| update / CONTEXT.UPDATE | `{ context, removeIds?, add?, ingress? }` | Context; remove, add, then ingress in that order; ingress has id/sourceNode/content/reference?/metadata? and records sourceNode in metadata |
| select / CONTEXT.SELECT | `{ context, purpose, query?, limit?, maxTokens?, strategy? }` | ContextSelection; deduplicate, cap items and tokens; no state/Memory/model mutation |
| compress / CONTEXT.COMPRESS | `{ context, maxItems?, maxTokens? }` | Context; deterministic group removal, no model summarization by default |
| execute | `execute(node, input, options?)` | Typed dispatch to the four leaves |

Results are independent, deeply frozen snapshots. IDs must be nonempty; explicit Context IDs must be unique; content must be finite, acyclic JSON. Request limit/maxItems/maxTokens allow 0 through 1000000. Numeric policy values are positive and at most 1000000. Requests cannot relax policy caps.

SELECT with purpose="infer" retains original protected/safety/currentGoal/pending and system groups before optional evidence, including when an injected RAG/provider strategy omits them. Providers cannot rewrite these groups. The default strategy ranks optional evidence using priority, relevance, query token overlap and position. Equal nonempty callId groups are selected atomically; optional groups that do not fit are skipped, while required groups exceeding item/token budgets throw BUDGET_UNSATISFIABLE. A provider returning only part of an optional input group fails with INVALID_PROVIDER_OUTPUT. purpose="memory" retains its separate eligibility semantics: the default strategy prioritizes memoryCandidate/reusable/stable and excludes private=true or memoryEligible=false; inference protection never forces private input into memory selection. SELECT is not tenant authorization. The fallback token estimate is ceil(JSON UTF-8 bytes / 4), not a model tokenizer.

COMPRESS protects protected/safety/currentGoal/pending=true or role=system items. Equal nonempty callId values form atomic groups. Low priority/relevance, retrievable and older groups are removed first, preserving remaining order. Unsatisfiable protected groups raise BUDGET_UNSATISFIABLE. Without a token budget it skips token estimation. Custom compressors cannot introduce IDs, remove or change protected groups (including content, source and metadata), or split callId groups; their output must satisfy item, inline and token limits.

## Optional cached state

Use `scope: { sessionId?, turnId?, invocationId? }`, with at least one nonempty identifier. The full tuple identifies a key: sessionId alone shares across turns; adding turnId isolates them. There is no parent-scope fallback or implicit Runtime request-ID mapping. Applications enforce tenant ownership and authorization, for example with tenant-qualified session IDs. Scope is not a credential.

| Call | Cached behavior |
| --- | --- |
| LOAD `{ scope, sources }` | Create or replace; sources=[] explicitly clears content |
| LOAD `{ scope }` | Read full state; missing/expired state raises CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND |
| UPDATE `{ scope, add?, ingress?, removeIds? }` | Read, compute, compare-and-set against the observed version |
| SELECT `{ scope, purpose, ... }` | Read and project without writing or refreshing TTL |
| COMPRESS `{ scope, ... }` | Read, compress, compare-and-set |

Do not combine scope and context. Only initialization LOAD creates missing state. Optional expectedVersion checks the read version. A mutation uses one read and one atomic CAS, with no automatic retry. Concurrent changes raise STATE_CONFLICT; reload and decide whether retrying is appropriate. Results remain Context/ContextSelection; use stateStore.get() when you need the version. Do not blindly replay business side effects on conflict.

Redis defaults: keyPrefix=`ditto:context:`, ttlMs=3600000. Keys append the identifier tuple's SHA-256. Each scope stores one JSON string with a random UUID version. Successful writes refresh TTL; reads do not. Expiry, eviction or Redis restart may remove temporary state. A single-key Lua script checks the version and SETs with PX, supporting single-key Redis Cluster routing without distributed locks or timers. See [Redis EVAL](https://redis.io/docs/latest/commands/eval/).

### Storage port

```ts
interface ContextStateStore {
  get(scope: ContextScope, options?: ContextCallOptions): Promise<StoredContext | undefined>;
  compareAndSet(scope: ContextScope, expectedVersion: string | undefined, next: Context, options?: ContextCallOptions): Promise<StoredContext>;
}
interface StoredContext { version: string; context: Context }
interface RedisContextClient {
  get(key: string): Promise<string | null>;
  eval(script: string, options: { keys: string[]; arguments: string[] }): Promise<unknown>;
}
```

Undefined expectedVersion means create only if missing; a supplied version must match or throw STATE_CONFLICT. External stores must implement atomic CAS and fresh versions to avoid ABA after expiration. `createRedisContextStore(client, options?)` also works independently. Connected node-redis clients match this port; other SDKs need get/eval forwarding functions.

Optional `ContextOperationQueue.enqueue(scope, operation, options?)` wraps cached calls. Use `createContextOperationQueue()` for bounded process-local serialization, or inject your own implementation. Storage CAS still enforces cross-process consistency.

## Strategy services

| Service / factory | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| tokenEstimator.estimate(content) | Nonnegative safe integer or Promise; skipped without a budget |
| selector.select(input) | Handles `{ kind: "provider", name, options? }`; resolves name and returns ContextItem[] |
| ragStrategy.select(input) | Handles `{ kind: "rag", corpus?: Reference, options? }`; query is MessageContent |
| createRagStrategy({ embed?, retrieve, rank? }) | Optional embed → required retrieve → optional rank; first item per ID wins; no extra Nodes |
| embed.embed({ query?, items, corpus?, options? }) | Arbitrary embedding passed to retrieve |
| retrieve.retrieve({ query?, items, corpus?, options?, embedding? }) | Returns `{ item: ContextItem, score?, metadata? }[]` |
| rank.rank({ query?, items, corpus?, options?, candidates }) | Returns candidates in selection priority order |
| compressor.compress(input) | Context preserving permitted IDs, protected items, correlated groups and budgets |
| referenceResolver.resolve(reference) | Used by LOAD with resolveReferences=true; otherwise references remain unresolved |

Candidate score/metadata are not automatically copied into item.metadata; explicitly map score to relevance if needed. SELECT returns a view; use UPDATE to persist additions. Reuse database search directly or delegate retrieve to an independent RETRIEVAL Worker, checking NodeResult and mapping complete ContextItems. Map unknown Memory/retrieval content explicitly into text/JSON.

`defaultSelect(input)`, `deterministicCompress(input, execution)` and `isProtectedContextItem(item)` support custom strategies. `createContextExecution(policy?, services?)` resolves frozen policy. Calling low-level strategy functions bypasses full SDK input/output validation.

Node descriptors `contextLoadNode`, `contextSelectNode`, `contextUpdateNode` and `contextCompressNode` expose `.type` and `.define(workerType, handler)` without registering a Worker. Low-level `loadNode/selectNode/updateNode/compressNode(input, execution)` take explicit input and ContextExecution; cached routing is supplied by createContext/createContextWorker. Prefer factories for normal use and leaf handlers for custom Worker reuse.

## Graphs and other Workers

- MEMORY.SEARCH → check NodeResult → map → CONTEXT.UPDATE. For durable writes, SELECT purpose=memory and explicitly map to MEMORY.WRITE.
- SELECT purpose=infer → map messages → INFER. INFER's ContextItem differs from the working ContextItem, including source type.
- INTERACTION.ACT.TOOL/MCP → OBSERVE → UPDATE; cached Graph bindings can pass scope at UPDATE.
- `runRagFlow(runtime, { context, query?, corpus?, limit?, maxTokens?, options? })` invokes SELECT's rag strategy and returns `{ output: ContextSelection, context }`.
- `runSkillFlow(runtime, { sources, context? })` LOADs resolved Skill content, then UPDATEs if context is supplied. Returns `{ output: Context, context }`; the application resolves Skill files and permissions.

These two helpers take explicit Context; cached Graphs can invoke the four nodes directly. Tools and models are not part of the default CONTEXT execution path.

## Errors and examples

| code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| INVALID_INPUT / UNKNOWN_NODE | Invalid input/node |
| INLINE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED / ITEM_LIMIT_EXCEEDED | Content/item limit exceeded |
| DUPLICATE_ITEM / MISSING_ITEM | Duplicate/removal policy rejection |
| STRATEGY_UNAVAILABLE | Missing or unsupported strategy |
| INVALID_PROVIDER_OUTPUT | Invalid selector/compressor/estimator result |
| BUDGET_UNSATISFIABLE | Protected items exceed budget |
| STATE_STORE_UNAVAILABLE / CONTEXT_NOT_FOUND | No store or missing state |
| STATE_CONFLICT / INVALID_STATE | Version conflict or corrupt stored data |

ContextError exposes code/message. Redis SDK, user-service, Runtime routing and transport exceptions can also reject directly. There are no background retries or successful empty results hiding failures.

  return { selected, full }; // SELECT does not persist its projection.
}
```

  const before = await store.get(scope);
  const written = await store.compareAndSet(scope, before?.version, { items: [{ id: "a", content: "one" }] });
  // A stale version rejects with STATE_CONFLICT; the application decides whether to retry.
  const context = createContext({ services: { stateStore: store } });
  await context.update({ scope, expectedVersion: written.version, add: [{ id: "b", content: "two" }] });
  return { key: contextScopeKey(scope), latest: await store.get(scope) };

  });
  return createContext({ services: { ragStrategy } }).select({
    context, purpose: "infer", query: "API", strategy: { kind: "rag" }, limit: 5,
  });
}
```

### Reuse a RETRIEVAL provider

  return createRagStrategy({ retrieve: { async retrieve(input) {
    const output = await provider.search({ query: { content: input.query ?? "" }, target, limit: 10 });
    return output.candidates.map(candidate => {
      const id = candidate.id ?? candidate.source?.ref;
      if (!id) throw new Error("Map retrieval candidates to stable Context IDs");
      return { item: {
      id,
      content: typeof candidate.content === "string" ? candidate.content : JSON.stringify(candidate.content),
      metadata: { ...(candidate.score === undefined ? {} : { relevance: candidate.score }) },
    } };
    });
  } } });
}
```

### Pass context to INFER

    ...selected.context.items.map(item => ({ role: "user" as const,
      content: typeof item.content === "string" ? item.content : JSON.stringify(item.content),
    })),
    { role: "user", content: "Explain the evidence." },
  ] });
}
```

### MEMORY and Context Graph

    .node("context", "CONTEXT.UPDATE", ["search"], (_query, { search }) => {
      if (search.status !== "success" || !search.output) throw new Error(search.error?.code ?? search.status);
      return { context: { items: [] }, ingress: search.output.map(hit => ({
        id: `memory:${hit.memory.id}`, sourceNode: "MEMORY.SEARCH" as const,
        content: typeof hit.memory.content === "string" ? hit.memory.content : JSON.stringify(hit.memory.content),
        metadata: { memoryId: hit.memory.id, ...(hit.score === undefined ? {} : { relevance: hit.score }) },

### Error handling

```ts
export async function contextErrors() {
  try { await createContext().load({ scope: { sessionId: "one" } }); }
  catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof ContextError) return error.code; // STATE_STORE_UNAVAILABLE
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Reuse built-in strategies

  })) });
}
```

  runtime: import("@codesoul-co/ditto").RuntimeClient,
  scope: import("@codesoul-co/ditto/worker/context").ContextScope,
  call: import("@codesoul-co/ditto/contracts").ToolCall,
) {
  const result = await runtime.invoke("INTERACTION.ACT.TOOL", { call });
  const observation = await runtime.invoke("INTERACTION.OBSERVE", { result });
  // The application chooses whether failed observations should enter its working set.
  if (observation.status !== "success") throw new Error(observation.error?.code ?? observation.status);
  return runtime.invoke("CONTEXT.UPDATE", { scope, ingress: [{
    id: `observation:${call.id}`, sourceNode: "INTERACTION.OBSERVE", content: observation.message.content,
    metadata: { callId: call.id, source: observation.source, status: observation.status },
  }] });
}
```

### Delegate to independent RETRIEVAL

```ts
export function remoteContextRetrieval(runtime: import("@codesoul-co/ditto").RuntimeClient, target: RetrievalTarget) {
  return contextRetrieval({ async search(input) {
    const result = await runtime.invoke("RETRIEVAL.SEARCH", input);
    if (result.status !== "success" || !result.output) throw new Error(result.error?.code ?? result.status);
    return result.output;
  } }, target);
}
```

## Local cache, queues and reference loading

`createInMemoryContextStore({ ttlMs?, maxEntries?, now? })` implements the same get/CAS port as Redis. Defaults are 3600000 ms and 1000 scopes. TTL must be 1–2147483647; maxEntries is a positive safe integer. `now` is an injectable millisecond clock. Reads update LRU order without extending TTL; writes refresh TTL, remove expired entries under capacity pressure, then evict the least recently used scope if needed. Values are immutable snapshots. There are no connections or background timers; state disappears with the process.

`createContextOperationQueue({ maxPending? })` defaults to 1024 pending/running operations across all scopes. Same-scope operations serialize; different scopes progress independently. Capacity exhaustion rejects with QUEUE_FULL. Failed jobs release capacity and do not block later jobs. Cancellation is checked before enqueue and at execution; canceled waiting jobs retain their slot until earlier jobs drain. Share the same queue/store instances across local replicas when they share state. A queue is not a distributed lock.

`load({ sources, resolveReferences: true })` resolves bare Reference entries in input order through `services.referenceResolver.resolve(reference, options?)`. The flag defaults to false and requires sources and a resolver. Existing Message/ContextItem values are unchanged. Resolved items retain the original stable ID and source URI, must be finite acyclic JSON and fit maxInlineBytes. Missing resolver raises RESOLVER_UNAVAILABLE; invalid output raises INVALID_PROVIDER_OUTPUT; excessive content raises INLINE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED. Resolver implementations own URI authorization and bounded I/O. No scheme or network access is enabled implicitly.

```ts
import { createContext, createInMemoryContextStore, createContextOperationQueue,
  loadRuntimeConfigFile } from "@codesoul-co/ditto";
const config = loadRuntimeConfigFile("ditto.yaml", process.env);
const store = createInMemoryContextStore(config.context.localCache);
const queue = createContextOperationQueue(config.context.queue);
const context = createContext({ services: {
  stateStore: store, operationQueue: queue,
  referenceResolver: { async resolve(reference, options) {
    options?.signal?.throwIfAborted();
    if (reference.uri !== "urn:goal") throw new Error("Unknown reference");
    return "Explain the retrieval pipeline";
  } },
} });
const scope = { sessionId: "example" };
await context.load({ scope, sources: [{ uri: "urn:goal" }], resolveReferences: true });
await Promise.all(["a", "b"].map(id => context.update({ scope, add: [{ id, content: id }] })));
const selected = await context.select({ scope, purpose: "infer", limit: 2 },
  { signal: AbortSignal.timeout(5000) });
const snapshot = await store.get(scope);
if (snapshot) await store.compareAndSet(scope, snapshot.version, snapshot.context);
await queue.enqueue(scope, async () => "application operation");
```

All SDK methods accept optional `ContextCallOptions` after input; execute accepts it as the third argument. `signal` propagates to selectors, RAG stages, compressors, token estimation, reference resolution, cache and queue ports. These ports accept options after their existing arguments (fourth for compareAndSet). Cancellation rejects the SDK call; cancellation before persistence prevents CAS. Cancellation cannot undo a completed external write. Runtime Workers supply the current signal and an invocation-bound `runtime` for nested delegation; applications normally only set signal.

For reusable inline or delegated database retrieval, see [Context retrieval adapter](retrieval-providers.md#context-retrieval-adapter) and the runnable [SQLite example](examples/integrations/context-retrieval.ts).

[Complete context workflows](context-workflows.md) show public Runtime composition, semantic summarization, durable checkpoints and package-consumer validation.
