# Documentation Map

**Start with [agent.json](agent-json.md): main Graph, Subgraphs, Loop and Worker registration/bindings.** The remaining material covers capabilities and advanced code-based integration.

[Developer handbook](handbook/index.md) (中文): project structure, Graph/Loop, tools, MCP, skills, database algorithms and Worker extensions.

**English** · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Start with the architecture and development guides, then follow the references for Worker communication, configuration, and capability extensions. Every guide is available in English and Simplified Chinese.

## Language Convention

Use `.md` for English and `.zh-CN.md` for Simplified Chinese. Each document links to its counterpart at the top. Update both versions together, preserving matching sections, API definitions, and examples. Keep navigation focused on user-facing documentation.
